Note Dockerfile differences:

1. I copy the project into the image.
2. I also included a bundle install so that this happens upon building the image
3. The CMD runs when the image is run, removing input from user to spin up application

Steps to run:

1. clone project from repo
2. goto repo root directory, then run:
    docker build . -t image-name:version
        # This copies the project into the image and installs the correct gem bundle
3. then run:
    docker run -it -p 3000:3000 image-name
        # This will automatically run the server from binding 0.0.0.0 making app
        # accessible from localhost:3000
4. TO QUIT: ctrl+c in interactive terminal to stop both application and container

If this process makes your life more difficult, let me know.
I will make my program runnable from the given Dockerfile with a few inputs from the user.
